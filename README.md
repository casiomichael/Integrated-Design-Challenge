# Integrated-Design-Challenge
The Integrated Design Challenge was a project for ECE110 at Duke in which students designed, constructed, and programmed a robot that can autonomously move, perform tasks (in this case, read RFID tags), and communicate via XBee with other robots to accomplish a Star-Wars Themed Task 

- In this repository, the code for my group (the Orange Squadron), is included, as well as the overall project task, and other groups' individual tasks.
